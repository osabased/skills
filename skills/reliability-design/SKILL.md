description: Designs failure semantics for non-event system behavior. Use when code involves retries, timeouts, idempotency, duplicate inputs, external service calls, background jobs, concurrency, partial failure, caching, stale reads, long-running operations, or recovery/reconciliation outside event-driven architecture.

# Reliability Design

## Overview

Design how a feature behaves when the normal path is interrupted. This skill is for reliability semantics before or during implementation: what can fail, what may be retried, what must be idempotent, what happens after partial success, and how the system recovers.

This is not a generic quality checklist. Use it only when failure behavior affects correctness, user trust, data integrity, or operability. Keep the output narrow enough to become tests, commands, or implementation constraints.

## When to Use

Use when a change includes or depends on:

- retries, backoff, timeouts, circuit breakers, or rate limits,
- idempotency keys, duplicate submissions, replayed requests, or repeated tool calls,
- external APIs, webhooks, filesystems, queues/jobs, email/SMS/payment providers, or other fallible boundaries,
- background jobs, scheduled tasks, long-running workflows, or async-but-not-event-architected work,
- concurrency, locks, optimistic updates, stale reads, caches, or race conditions,
- partial failure where one side effect succeeds and a later step fails,
- recovery, reconciliation, compensation, or manual repair paths.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for pure event-driven architecture reliability; use `event-driven-architecture` and its `RELIABILITY.md` file. Do not use for active debugging; use `diagnose`. Do not use for generic test strategy without specific failure semantics; use `shift-left-testing`. Do not add retries, caches, queues, or locks just because this skill is active.

## Core Rule

Reliability is not “try again.” Reliability is a specific contract for failure, duplication, timing, ordering, recovery, and evidence.

Every retry, timeout, cache, lock, or recovery path must answer: what failure is it handling, what new failure can it create, and how will we know it worked?

## Process

### 1. Name the operation and correctness risk

```text
OPERATION
- User/system-visible action:
- Durable state touched:
- External systems touched:
- Correctness risk if interrupted:
```

If the operation is actually an event contract, consumer, projection, saga, outbox/inbox, DLQ, or replay problem, stop and route to `event-driven-architecture`.

### 2. Map failure modes

List only failures that would change implementation or tests.

```text
FAILURE MODES
- Timeout or slow dependency:
- Transient external failure:
- Permanent external rejection:
- Duplicate request/input:
- Partial success:
- Concurrent update/race:
- Stale cached/read data:
- Recovery/restart after crash:
```

Mark irrelevant rows as `n/a`; do not invent risks.

### 3. Define failure semantics

For each relevant failure, decide the behavior.

| Concern | Decision to make |
|---|---|
| Timeout | How long to wait, where timeout is enforced, what user/job sees. |
| Retry | Which errors retry, max attempts, backoff/jitter, and stop condition. |
| Idempotency | Key/scope, dedupe store/window, and duplicate response behavior. |
| Partial failure | Commit boundary, compensation, reconciliation, or manual repair path. |
| Concurrency | Lock/version/transaction strategy and conflict behavior. |
| Cache/staleness | Freshness requirement, invalidation, stale-while-revalidate, or bypass. |
| External rejection | Whether to surface, retry later, quarantine, or require user action. |
| Restart recovery | How in-progress work is resumed, skipped, reconciled, or marked failed. |

Prefer making operations naturally idempotent over adding superficial dedupe wrappers.

### 4. Choose observability and repair evidence

A reliability design is incomplete if operators cannot answer what happened.

Minimum useful evidence:

- correlation/request/job ID,
- operation state transitions,
- retry count and final outcome,
- timeout vs rejection vs validation failure distinction,
- idempotency/dedupe decision when applicable,
- reconciliation or manual repair signal when applicable.

Do not log secrets, raw credentials, or unnecessary personal data.

### 5. Convert semantics into tests and gates

Hand off to `shift-left-testing` when the test seam is unclear. Hand off to `test-driven-development` when the next behavior is ready for red-green-refactor.

At minimum, specify:

```text
RELIABILITY TESTS
- Duplicate input test:
- Timeout/transient failure test:
- Permanent failure test:
- Partial-success recovery test:
- Concurrency/stale-read test:
- Restart/reconciliation test:
```

Use only the tests that match real failure modes.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Just retry it." | Retrying deterministic failures creates storms, duplicate side effects, and slower incidents. |
| "This almost never fails." | Rare dependency failures still need a defined user-visible and data-integrity outcome. |
| "The provider/API handles idempotency." | Provider idempotency may not cover your local state, retries, callbacks, or user response. |
| "A cache will make it faster." | Caches add staleness and invalidation semantics; use them only when the tradeoff is explicit. |
| "We can repair manually." | Manual repair is a reliability design only if detection, ownership, and exact repair steps exist. |
| "The test can mock success." | Reliability tests must exercise failure and recovery, not only the happy path. |

## Red Flags

- retry loop with no max attempts, backoff, jitter, or non-retryable classification,
- timeout only at the outer UI/request layer while inner calls can hang,
- side effects can run twice without idempotency or compensation,
- duplicate submit/replay creates two durable records, charges, emails, or jobs,
- partial success leaves no status that recovery can find,
- cache correctness is assumed but no freshness requirement exists,
- concurrency is hand-waved as "unlikely",
- background job failure is invisible unless a user reports it,
- recovery depends on reading logs manually with no repair path,
- tests cover success but no failure or duplicate path.

## Verification

After using this skill:

- [ ] Event-driven reliability concerns were routed to `event-driven-architecture` instead
- [ ] Only relevant failure modes were included
- [ ] Timeout, retry, idempotency, partial failure, concurrency, cache/staleness, and recovery semantics were decided where applicable
- [ ] Retryable and non-retryable failures were separated
- [ ] Duplicate handling has a concrete key/scope or is explicitly unnecessary
- [ ] Observability exposes operation outcome and repair signals without leaking sensitive data
- [ ] At least one reliability test or gate is specified for each high-cost failure mode
- [ ] The next skill is named: `shift-left-testing`, `test-driven-development`, `diagnose`, `continuous-delivery-readiness`, or normal execution
